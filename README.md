# QRFactorisation
QR Factorisition using GramSchmidt process and numpy
a program in Python to find the QR factorization of an m×n matrix. The program takes both m and n, as well as the entries of the matrix A, as inputs.

The output of the program is an m×n matrix Q and an n×n matrix R such that A = QR. Q is a matrix which has the property that Q'Q = I and R is triangular.
